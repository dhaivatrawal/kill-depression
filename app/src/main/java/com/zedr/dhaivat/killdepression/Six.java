Obviously, if you had a physical disability it wouldn't be legal for an employer to discriminate against you, thanks to the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), which came into effect in 1992 to prevent private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies, and labor unions from discriminating against people with disabilities. It applies to job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, and more. Businesses or companies with 15 or more employees are required to comply with the ADA.\n" +

If you're experiencing depression, knowing your rights in the workplace can make a substantial difference in how you cope."));

Problems not covered by the ADA include adjustment disorders, relationship troubles, or illegal drug use. In addition, behavior \"traits\" such as irritability or stress are not included.\n" +

If your employer does not know about your depression and then later discovers a substance abuse problem, you will not be protected."));
